# iTerm - oh my zsh config

This is the base configuration of Oh My Zsh that I use on multiple devices. 

## Plugins & theme

- `git` plugin: it is already included with the installation of Oh My Zsh, just add it to the active plugins.  
Here's a link to my personal Notion with a brief cheatsheet I wrote with the more common and useful commands imo: https://lelakuhl.notion.site/Cheatsheet-Git-plugin-Oh-My-Zsh-53f36ec0d71842f48f5737dd5a1abf5a
- `zsh-autosuggestions` plugin: it suggests command based on your history and previous completitions.

## Aliases

The aliases are mainly for the use of the git flow branching strategy.  
The package I use on my machine is `git-flow-avh`. It can be installed with brew (`brew install git-flow-avh` - https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/git-flow-avh).  

If you're not into brew, here's other form of installation: https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh/wiki/Installing-on-Mac-OS-X
